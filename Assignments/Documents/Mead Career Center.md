## Career Center Reflection

One thing I learned from the Career Center presentation is that there is a difference in paper for resumes.
I had always printed my resumes on just regular copy paper, which look back now does feel a little silly but how was I supposed to know.

So, now I know another way to stand out to a potential employer.  An Ivory (or creme) resume, printed on a little thicker stock.
I also know to email the Career Center if I would like a few resumes printed on such paper.  Not my silly lower class paper.
